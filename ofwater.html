<p>3/4ths of Earths surface is covered with water. Because of that Earth is called the "water planet".
Due to growing population,groundwater is being used up very fast, leaving very little time for it to be replenished</p>
<h2>Sources of water</h2>
<p> 97% of the WATER in Earth is in the oceans and seas.And the rest of the 3% are in rivers which are 0.5% of Earth's WATER and 2.1% in the form of ice.</p>
<p> 0.4% of the rest is in lakes and ponds and groundwater.</p>
<p>And 0.1% in our water storage facilities and dams.</p>
<p>Thus conclusively:Ocean and sea bodies being saline and glaciers innaccesible. Only water from rivers, lakes and ponds which are about 1% of the water are available to us.</p>
<p>Fresh water accounts for only about 2.7%  ,70% of this are glaciers and icesheets.</p>
<p>Therefore we must use water carefully.</p>
