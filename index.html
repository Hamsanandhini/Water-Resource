<p>Water  is  a  vital  renewable  natural  resource.</p>
<p>Water is also the best all-around solvent.</p>
<p> More solid substances dissolve in water than in any other liquid.</p>
<p>Water expands by 9% when it freezes. Frozen water (ice) is lighter than water, which is why ice floats in water.</p>
<p> Water is the only substance on earth that is found naturally in three forms: liquid, solid and gas. </p>
<p>Pure water has no smell and no taste. It also has a pH level of around 7.</p>
<p>Most of the water found on the earth's surface is permanently frozen or salty.</p>
